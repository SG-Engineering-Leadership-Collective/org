# Singapore Engineering Leadership Collective

We are a group of engineering leaders (tech leads, engineering managers, CTOs) based in Singapore.

We hope to use this space to share our experiences and challenges in our work. We will try to keep things casual around here and build up a community together.

## Rationale

We noticed that there was a lack of opportunity to gather a bunch of senior engineering people and talk shop - technology, people management and processes. Most problems we face have probably been solved, and what's missing is the ability to share with a larger community.
